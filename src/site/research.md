> Roosevelt Island is a narrow island in New York City's East River. It lies between Manhattan Island to its west and the borough of Queens, on Long Island, to its east. It is politically part of the borough of Manhattan. Running from the equivalent of East 46th to 85th Streets on Manhattan Island, it is about 2 miles long, with a maximum width of 800 feet.

— [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_Island)

Roosevelt Island has a very rich history. In 1637, the island was bought by a Dutch governor from the Canarsie Indians. The island changed hands after the British took over in 1666. Two decades later, the island was inherited by the Blackwell family. In 1825, New York City bought the island after which a whole lot went down. The city needed a place to keep prisoners and other folks deemed “unfit” for the city; Blackwell's island seemed like the perfect place. The city erected numerous hospitals, a penitentiary, and an insane asylum on the island. People who where send to the island seldom returned.. 

Even though the island has a very eery history, there isn't much of that “darkness” left on the island today. It has turned in to a sprawling urban center filled with modern developments. Relics of the old days are still visible between the glass and steel that has been built since.

## Roosevelt Island Historic Society

The purpose of the Society is to recover, maintain and disseminate the record of Roosevelt Island’s heritage from Colonial times to the present. The Society aims to achieve these goals as follows:

- By collecting artifacts, documents, publications, photographs, prints and other media recording the history of the island and its inhabitants.
- By maintaining those collections and making them accessible to the public.
- By conducting educational programs, including tours, lectures, exhibitions and publications.

### Current Roosevelt Island Historical Tour

The current Historical Tour on the Island is on a website. The website is very hard to navigate to and it has very little exposure.  The tour has two different path: South Tour and North Tour. Each path has difference stops, which you can learn about through their website. However the website doesn't really work on the mobile.

We learn about that the website has detailed information of each location. It describes about the important events and images of different time period.  

After looking at the Historical Tour. We came up with a design question: How might we create a better experience for people to learn about the history of Roosevelt Island?

### On-Site Research

We visited the island as a group to check out the RIHS' Visitor Center and the different landmarks, mainly preserved buildings from the island's past. We noted the different stops that visitors would be interested in seeing and the best route for getting to each stop.

We spoke to a few people at the island — some were out-of-state visitors and some were residents of the island.

Here, we also started to craft the storyline of our mystery game.
