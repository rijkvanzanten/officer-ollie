### Stop 1 — Visitor Center / Tram

The player has made their way to Roosevelt Island. At the visitor kiosk they are greeted by Detective Dan.

DETECTIVE DAN

Thanks for coming on such a short notice detective.. ehh.. what was your name again?

PLAYER

[enters name]

DETECTIVE DAN

Ah! [name], of course, how could I forget. Something disastrous has happened.. There was a huge fire yesterday at the prison hospital and word has it that a felon has escaped! I would've gone myself if I weren't stuck here doing all this paperwork..

If you could, would you kindly go over to the rubbles of the prison and see what's up? It shouldn't be too hard to find, it's near that huge cloud of smoke over there.

Oh! Before I forget, take Officer Ollie with you! 

OFFICER OLLIE

Woof woof! 

(Hi there! I'm Ollie :-) ) 

DETECTIVE DAN

Okay, off you go! 

Interface changes to show smoke on the side of the screen. If the user tilts or reorients their phone, the smoke is visible on a different side. Because of this, the smoke acts as a compass pointing to the burned down hospital.

*User walks to the City Hospital*

### Stop 2 — City Hospital

At the City Hospital, the user is stopped by Firefighter Frank

FIREFIGHTER FRANK

Stop right there! It's not safe here.

...

Oh.. You're a detective eh? I see. Well, when we just arrived here, there were a bunch of people standing around here doing nothing. Some of them were screaming about how there was someone running out of the hospital carrying a bag full of stuff. We haven't been able to track him down, but maybe you'll have more luck.

OFFICER OLLIE

Woof! (Where'd he go?!)

FIREFIGHTER FRANK

Supposedly, he ran in the direction of the park not far from here. Beats me why he would choose that route though, doesn't seem like there's an exit that way [surprised].

OFFICER OLLIE

Wrooof! 

(Lets check out the park!)

FIREFIGHTER FRANK

Sure go ahead, doubt that you'll find much though.

*User walks to the Four Freedoms Park*

---

### Stop 3 — Four Freedoms Park

As soon as the player and Ollie reach the park, Ollie notices something

OFFICER OLLIE

Woof woof woooof! (What's that!?)

...

Wooooof woof! (What is this thing?!...)

The interface shows ollie's head front and center. When the user gets close to an item of interest, Ollie will start barking and the phone will start shaking. 

Camera shows item on the floor. In the dialog box Ollie speaks. The item is a torn off piece of (bright orange) jumpsuit.

OFFICER OLLIE

Woof woof. (Eww this thing smells. Yuck.)

Wooof woof. (This smell is all over the place. There must be more where that came from.)

Ollie and the player continue searching. When they reach the second item, Ollie steps in again. Second item is drips / smears of an unknown bright neon green substance.

OFFICER OLLIE

[ ಠ_ಠ ] Woof.. (What is this...?)

...

Wooof woof (Where did this come from?)

Ollie and the player find the last of three items. This time, it's a sketchy looking broken container with more of the unknown substance.

OFFICER OLLIE

Woof woof woof (It looks like... some sort of... soda?)

Woof woof (nah.. that can't be it, that wouldn't smell so awful)

Wooof woof woof (I think my friend at the lab can help figure out what this is)

Ollie is shown on the screen with his head pointing to the direction of the lab. The closer the player gets to the lab, the brighter the screen gets. In order to see where Ollie is going, the user has to lower the brightness of their phone.

*User walks to the laboratory*

---

### Stop 4 — Laboratory

The player is greeted by Researcher Rachel.

RESEARCHER RACHEL

.....

........

I'm busy. What do you want.

...

OFFICER OLLIE

Woof! (Heya!)

RESEARCHER RACHEL

Oh hey Ollie! Long time no see, how are you?

OFFICER OLLIE

Wroooof. (We found this at the park. Any idea what it is?)

RESEARCHER RACHEL

Hmm, haven't seen that before. You can use my extractinator 3000 to figure out what is though.

OFFICER OLLIE

Woof! (Sounds good :D )

Player plays mini game in which they complete a puzzle to figure out what the substance is.

## Visual Language

Mood-board

Through out our paper prototype we got the inspiration from our user that this game could potentially be fun to play with children. We want to put in cartoon illustration yet old element into the design. We got our inspiration from the game Professor Layton. Which is a game on Nintendo 3Ds, and now it is available in the app store. The game captured fun and mystical story in the design. 

Color Palette 

Our color palette is chosen based on the mood-board we created. We wanted to used more then 5 colors because the design has a lot of illustration element in it. The color also has a yellow ash overlay, because this will add an old feeling to the palette. 

Typography 

We mainly has Three typography. The logo typography we used are Poppins and American Typewritter. The typography Poppins has rounded corners in the design. And it reflects the feeling of friendly and welcoming.  On the other hand the typography American Typewriter has a old and historical feeling. The third typography we used is Roboto. This type is used through out the entire application. The reason we choose Roboto is because it is a flexible and easy to read typography. It is portrait clearly in both paragraphs and titles. 

## Design System

We used the methods of Atomic Design.
