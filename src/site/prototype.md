# Prototype & Validation

## Paper Prototype

We created a portable paper prototype because it would enable us to test our concepts and the general features of the application with multiple users without having them be at the island physically. The paper prototype consisted of a map of the island with the stops marked and cards representing the different screens users would see on their smartphones.

## Paper Prototype Testing + Insights

We tested the paper prototype on 4 different users. Below are some key quotes: 

- “This is an interesting way to learn about the history of Roosevelt Island. But what would happen if I can’t figure out the puzzles?”
- “This will be a fun game to play as a family. I think the challenges will keep my kid engaged for awhile.”
- “It is a little difficult to imagine how the AR will work in the application. But I get the idea of walking around while playing the game.”
- “I am a big fan of Pokemon Go. I like the idea of being able to travel to a new place with an interactive game.”

In general, the users really liked the idea of learning the history of RI through an interactive walking tour and game. Not only would they feel motivated to be active, the challenges and narrative will continue their engagement with the application. 

One of the users was concerned about the difficulty of the puzzles, so we decided to include a "help" button on each screen and designate Ollie as a guide. Another user had trouble imagining how the AR would work, but this is just a restrictions of  paper prototypes; it should not be a problem in the hi-fi prototype.

## Hi-Fi Prototype

With a finalized visual design and design system, we created a high fidelity prototype. This version of the prototype allowed users to experience the different interactive elements of the application. 

## Hi-Fi Prototype Testing + Insights

We tested our hi-fi prototype with 1 user on the island. The following are her main feedback: 

- “I wish there were more interactive applications like this so that I can be motivated to go outside and learn new things.”
- “I love the idea of playing a game while walking around because I can feel more active.”
- “I never thought about the history of Roosevelt Island, even though I live on the island. But I would want to play this game.”

The result of the testing was surprisingly successful. We got a lot of positive feedback from our test user. However, we believe we still need to conduct more tests to learn more about the success of our design.
