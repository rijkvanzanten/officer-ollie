# Officer Ollie

This is the documentation for our second project for [Major Studio 1](https://courses.newschool.edu/courses/PMCD5101/5431/). Major Studio examines the fundamentals of digital product design, including user research techniques, production methods, wireframing, and prototyping. The project brief was rather simple: “build an app”. We decided to team up to combine our strengths and make a project that we couldn't have done by ourselves.

## The Team

* [Victoria Duong](https://www.victoriatduong.com)
* [Rachel Sun](https://iamyufeisun.com)
* [Rijk van Zanten](https://rijks.website)

## The Project

We quickly decided that we would want to focus our efforts on creating an app for a non-profit organization in the city. This “limitation” would give us a well defined scope and stakeholder to work with. Victoria came up with the idea to do something with Roosevelt Island. Having lived on the island herself for a little bit, she knew that there was a lot of history and things to explore on the island, but also realized that there aren't a lot of people actually coming to the island as a past time activity.

### Roosevelt Island Historic Society

We found an organization that promotes awareness of the island's unique story and pursues preservation of its landmarks and artifacts. We reached out to the organization to see if we could schedule an interview to learn more about the island and the activities the organization organizes, but unfortunately they stopped responding. We decided to move on with the idea, as we'd became fascinated with the island and it's rich history.


### Walking Tour

The RIHS has an existing walking tour available on [their website](http://rihs.us/riwalk/). While the content of the walking tour is pretty comprehensive, there were a lot to gain in terms of usability and design. The tour wasn't optimized for mobile use and is clearly meant to be used before you go to the island. We decided to turn this into our project.

## Problem Definition

Roosevelt Island has [a rich history](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/hillary-clinton-roosevelt-island-history-118970) but [doesn't have a lot of people coming](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/roosevelt-island-things-to-do-new-york/index.html) to the island to check it out.

## Design Challenge

How can we design a walking tour app that entices people to come to and explore Roosevelt Island using an interactive application on a smartphone?

## Stakeholders

### End User

The person using the app to explore the island. The user wants to learn more about the island and needs to have a reason to go explore it.

### RIHS

Even though they're not directly involved, RIHS is still a big stakeholder. With them being the ultimate source on historic information on the island, we'll be heavily dependent on their information and knowledge in order to provide accurate information in the walking tour.

### Parsons School of Design

To make this project any good as a school project, we need to document it thorougly.

## Focus

The focus of this project will be on ideation and visual design. 

## Trends and Threats

Roosevelt Island has been gaining a lot of popularity lately in [various](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/roosevelt-island-things-to-do-new-york/index.html) [travel blogs](https://perceptivetravel.com/blog/2018/10/18/a-manhattan-oasis-on-roosevelt-island/). This will increase people's awareness and interest in going to the island. However, it'll still be challenge to motivate people to make the trip to the island because public transit options are limited.

## Product Vision

We envision creating an app that will draw users to the island, educate them about the rich history of the island, and offer a fun experience for users that will not only encourage them to finish the tour but will also make them want to return to the island in the future.
