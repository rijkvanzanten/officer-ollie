# Officer Ollie

Sipping on Rosé, Silver Lake sun, coming up all lazy. I know there will be sacrifice but that's the price. Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. So we hit the boulevard. They say, be afraid you're not like the others, futuristic lover. I want my heart throbbin', ground shakin', show stoppin', amazin'. This one goes out to the ladies at breakfast in last night's dress. Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy. You held me down, but I got up (HEY!). I know there will be sacrifice but that's the price.

Make me your Aphrodite. You could've been the greatest. Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed. Her love is like a drug. I hope you got a healthy appetite. Yeah, she dances to her own beat. Think the city towed my car, chandeliers on the floor. You're so hypnotizing, could you be the devil? Could you be an angel? Boy all this time was worth the waiting. Yeah, she's so in demand. It's always been inside of you, you, you. Playing ping pong all night long, everything's all neon and hazy.

## Major Studio 1

In this course we will examine the fundamentals of digital product design, including user research techniques, production methods for interactive applications, wireframing, and prototyping. We will investigate the interface, mechanism, controls, and aims of digital platforms. Students will learn how to design and develop complex digital products and mobile applications as they undertake comprehensive research to direct their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome. Students will utilize tools to conceive, plan, and develop an interactive system, and they will become well versed in their role within the development of interactive media. The course expands on students’ existing understanding of programming languages used for digital prototyping.
